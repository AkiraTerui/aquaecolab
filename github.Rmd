# WHY GITHUB?

---
Why GitHub? There are two reasons.

- **It keeps your codes (and other materials too) on an online repository**. This feature enables you to share your codes seamlessly with others and to store your codes at a secured place.
- **It tracks changes in the codes**. Tracking changes is extremely important to avoid unintended errors in your codes. This feature also help avoid creating redundant files.
