# GETTING STARTED

---

## Install R and R Studio

R and R Studio can be installed from the following websites:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (you can choose any CRAN mirror to download)
- [R Studio](https://rStudio.com/products/rStudio/download/)

While R is stand-alone software, I strongly recommend to use it with R Studio. R Studio has many functions that help your data analysis.
\
\

## Basic Setup

### Interface

![](image/R_image1.png)

R Studio interface. The left half of the screen is **“console”** where you put your script to execute calculation/data manipulation/analysis (ignore the tab “Terminal” at this point). The right bottom shows a folder in which you are working now – i.e., **“working folder or directory”**. R does not recognize any files outside of this folder, so be sure to pick the right directory when you work in R.

### Create Project
As you proceed, numerous materials will be generated. How do we manage files? No worries, R Studio will help organize files by creating a project. To initiate the process of creating a project:

a. go to `File > New Project` on the top menu
b. select `New Directory`
c. select `New Project`

A new window pops up and prompts you to name a directory and where to put the directory in your computer. Click `Browse` to select a location for the directory. I would create a folder for R projects (e.g., `RProject`) and save project directories under this folder. Click **Create Project** once you decided directory name and location:

![](image/R_image5.png)

### Find Where You Are
Once you created a project, R Studio will take you to where the R project is located. Check the current directory using the following script:

```{r}
getwd()
```

However, when you next open R Studio, the initial location could be somewhere else. In that case, go to `File > Open Project` and open the `.Rproj` file that you just created. This will take you to the directory you are supposed to be.
\
\

## Object

### Create Object
Let’s play with R. Put the following script in your console.

```{r}
x <- c(10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2)
```

This script creates a vector of numbers composed of {10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2}. `x` is a ‘box’ where the vector information is stored, and ‘<-’ is the arrow that commands R to store {10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2} in a box `x`. `x` is referred to as an **object**. Let’s see what’s in `x`:

```{r}
x
```

R has many functions that calculate the mean, median, etc. Let’s calculate a mean and median for `x`:

```{r}
mean(x)
median(x)
```

Also, you can pick an element(s) as you wish. Numbers in brackets `[]` specifies the numbered ID of each element. In the above example, element `x[3]` is `8.8`. You can extract this information with the following script:

```{r}
x[3]
```

You can also choose multiple elements simultaneously. For example, `3:5` specifies elements starting from 3 to 5 (colon creates a sequence of numbers):

```{r}
3:5
x[3:5]
```

If you want to pick elements that are not ordered sequentially, you can use `c()` to specify multiple elements:

```{r}
c(1,4)
x[c(1,4)]
```

### Case Sensitive
Importantly, **objects are case sensitive**. Let's see what happens when you create an object `x` (lower case):

```{r}
# create an object `x` (lower case)
x <- 3

# check what's in object `x` (lower)
print(x) 
```

There is a number saved in the object `x`. Try `X` (upper case):

```{r, error = TRUE}

print(X)

```

This returns a message `Error: object 'X' not found`. This is because R distinguishes lower and upper cases. To see the difference, create the object `X`:

```{r}

# create an object `x` (upper case)
X <- 5

# check what's in object `X` (upper)
print(X) 

# check what's in object `x` (lower)
print(x) 

```

Thus, lower `x` and upper `X` can save different information.
\
\

## Arithmetic Operations

### Number

Addition

```{r}
1 + 1
121 + 123
```

Subtraction

```{r}
1 - 1 
121 - 123
```

Multiplication

```{r}
1 * 1
121 * 123
```

Division

```{r}
1 / 1
121 / 123
```

Power

```{r}
2^2
```

Square root

```{r}
sqrt(4)
4^(1/2)
```

### Object

R can handle arithmetic operations between objects. Prepare objects `x` and `y`:

```{r}

x <- 1:5
y <- 2:6

print(x)
print(y)

```

You can use objects instead of directly entering numbers. R automatically performs arithmetic operations for each element. For example, enter `y-x`:

```{r}
y - x
```

This is equivalent to:

$$
y[1] - x[1]\\
y[2] - y[2]\\
...\\
y[n] - x[n]
$$

You can save the results as another object:

```{r}
z <- y - x
print(z)
```
\
\

## R Script

In R Studio, we rarely write scripts directly in R console. This is because console **does NOT save your scripts**, so it is difficult to keep records of data manipulation and analysis. Instead, we write our scripts in an **R script**, which enables you save and organize scripts in a separate window and allows you to run scripts when you are ready.

### Create R Script

To create an **R script**:

a. go to `File > New File > R Script` (or `Ctrl + Shift + N`)
b. then, you will see a new window of R script in the left top

![](image/R_image7.png)

### Run R Script

You can run your script from the R script window. Write the following scripts:

```{r eval = F}
x <- c(10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2)
mean(x)
```

Once you write scripts in the R Script window, the tab text will turn into <span style="color: red;">red</span>.
This means this **R Script** file is edited but **unsaved**. You can save the file by `Ctrl + s` or by clicking the `floppy disk` icon on the top bar.
Writing these scripts in the R script window does not execute any calculation. To execute, select lines and `Ctrl + Enter`. Selected scripts will appear in the console and execute what you commanded:

![](image/R_image8.png)
\
\

## Compile Report

R Studio has a function to compile a report from R scripts (see also [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) for details). Include the following script on the top of the R script file to put your information:

```{r eval = F}
#' ---
#' title: "Report"
#' author: Your Name
#' date: Jan 16, 2020
#' output: html_document
#' ---
```

Each argument determines the following:

- `title` title of your report
- `author` this appears below the title in the compiled report
- `date` date created
- `output` output format; use `html_document`

Click on the "compile" button on the top. This creates a report from your R script:

![](image/R_image10.png)

The R Studio will start compiling your report. Here is some rules when compiling a report.

- Your script will appear in a grey box. Put `#` if you want leave a comment on the script.
- Output from your script will appear in a white box with double sharps
- Text after `#'` will show up outside a grey box (text after `#` will be regarded as Header)

For example, the following script is compiled like this:

```{r eval = F}

#' ---
#' title: "Report"
#' author: Your Name
#' date: Jan 16, 2020
#' output: html_document
#' ---

#' # Header 1.1
#' ## Header 1.2
#' ### Header 1.3
#' This appears outside boxes

# inbox comment here
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
x

#' # Header 2.1
#' ## Header 2.2
#' ### Header 2.3
#' This text can be used to guide readers

# inbox comment here
y <- 1:9
y

```

![](image/R_image11.png)
\
\

## File Management

As you proceed, the number of files will increase. It is critical to learn basic rules of **how to locate and name your files in your computer**. Here are some recommendations:

- Put all the relevant files in a single folder.
  - R scripts and associated files should be saved in the project folder.
  - Create a new R project when working on different topics. Do not mix them up in a single folder.
- Avoid space and period when naming files. Instead, use underscore or hyphen.
  - Do: `script_week1.R` `script-week1.R`
  - Don't: `script week1.R`
- Use lowercase.
  - Do: `script_week1.R`
  - Don't: `Script_week1.R`
- Keep consistent.
  - For example, if your R script deals with figures, then name it `figure_XXX.R` (`XXX` identifies further details).
- Numbering will help keep your folder/directory organized.
  - `figure_temperature.R`, `figure_precipitation.R`...this will work, but the order of files may be confusing.
  - `figure01_temperature.R`, `figure02_precipitation.R`...this will order files by group (`figure`) and then numerically.

# DATA STRUCTURE

---

## Overview

R has 6 basic **data types**.

- character: `"aquatic"`, `"ecology"` (no order)
- factor: similar to character, but has *levels* (alphabetically ordered by default)
- numeric: `20.0` , `15.5`
- integer: `3`, `7`
- logical: `TRUE` , `FALSE`
- complex: `1+2i` (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

These elements form one of the following **data structures**.  

- **vector**: a series of elements. A single data type is allowed in a single vector
- **matrix**: elements organized into rows and columns. A single data type is allowed in a single matrix
- **data frame**: looks similar to a matrix, but allows different data types in different columns

\
\

## Vector
### Create Vector

Below are examples of atomic character vectors, numeric vectors, integer vectors, etc. There are many ways to create vector data. The following examples use `c()`, `:`, `seq()`, `rep()`:

```{r}

#ex.1a manually create a vector using c()
x <- c(1,3,4,8)
x

#ex.1b character
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
x

#ex.1c logical
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
x

#ex.2 sequence of numbers
x <- 1:5
x

#ex.3a replicate same numbers or characters
x <- rep(2, 5) # replicate 2 five times
x

#ex.3b replicate same numbers or characters
x <- rep("a", 5) # replicate "a" five times
x

#ex.4a use seq() function
x <- seq(1, 5, by = 1)
x

#ex.4b use seq() function
x <- seq(1, 5, by = 0.1)
x

```

### Check Features

R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example:

- `class()` - what kind of object (data structure) is it (high-level)?
- `typeof()` - what is the object’s data type (low-level)?
- `attributes()` - does it have any metadata?
- `length()` - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
- `sum()` - what is the summed number of the data?
- `mean()` - what is the average number of the data?

**Numeric Vector**

```{r}

x <- c(1.2, 3.1, 4.0, 8.2)
x
class(x)
typeof(x)
length(x)
sum(x)
mean(x)

```

**Character Vector**

```{r}

y <- c("a", "b", "c")
class(y)
length(y)

```
  
### Access

**Element ID**\
Use brackets `[]` when accessing specific elements in an object.
For example, if you want to access element #2 in the vector `x`, you may specify as `x[2]`:

```{r}

x <- c(2,2,3,2,5)
x[2] # access element #2
x[c(2,4)] # access elements #2 and 4
x[2:4] # access elements #2-4

```

**Equation**\
R provides many ways to access elements that suffice specific conditions. You can use mathematical symbols to specify what you need, for example:
o
- `==` equal
- `>` larger than
- `>=` equal & larger than
- `<` smaller than
- `<=` equal & smaller than
- `which()` a function that returns element # that suffices the specified condition

The following examples return a logical vector indicating whether each element in x suffices the specified condition:

```{r}

# creating a vector
x <- c(2,2,3,2,5)

# ex.1a equal
x == 2

# ex.1b larger than
x > 2 

```

You can access elements that suffice the specified condition using brackets, for example:

```{r}

# ex.2a equal
x[x == 2]
# ex.2b larger than
x[x > 2]

```

Using `which()`, you can see which elements (i.e., #) matches what you need:

```{r}

# ex.3a equal
which(x == 2) # returns which elements are equal to 2
# ex.3b larger than
which(x > 2)

```

\o
\

## Matrix
### Create Matrix

Matrix is a set of elements (*single data type*) that are organized into rows and columns:

```{r}

#ex.1 cbind: combine objects by column
x <- cbind(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))
x

#ex.2 rbind: combine objects by row
x <- rbind(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))
x

#ex.3 matrix: specify elements and the number of rows (nrow) and columns (ncol)
x <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
x

```

### Check Features

R provides many functions to examine features of matrix data, for example:

- `class()` what kind of object (data type) is it (high-level)?
- `typeof()` what is the object’s data type (low-level)?
- `attributes()` does it have any metadata?
- `dim()` how long are rows and columns?
- `rowSums()` what is the summed number of the data for each row?
- `colSums()` what is the summed number of the data for each column?

**Integer Matrix**\

```{r}

x <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
x
class(x)
typeof(x)
dim(x)

```

**Character Matrix**\

```{r}

y <- matrix(c("a","b", "c", "d", "e", "f"), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
y
class(y)
typeof(y)
dim(y)

```

### Access

When accessing matrix elements, you need to pick row(s) and/or column(s), for example:

```{r}

x <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
x
x[2,3] # access an element in row #2 and colum #3
x[2,] # access elements in row #2
x[c(2,3),] # access elements in rows #2 and 3
x[,c(2,3)] # access elements in columns #2 and 3

```

You can assess each element with mathematical expressions just like vectors:

```{r}

x == 2 # equal
x > 2 # larger than

```

However, care must be taken when accessing elements, as it will be automatically converted to vector data:

```{r}

x[x == 2] # equal
x[x > 2] # larger than

```

`which()` needs an additional argument to return both row and column #:

```{r}

which(x == 2, arr.ind = TRUE)
which(x > 2, arr.ind = TRUE)

```

\
\

## Data Frame

Data frame is a set of elements that are organized into rows and columns, but differ from matrix in several ways.

- it allows *multiple data types* in different columns
- each column has its *name*
- you can access columns by name (using `$`)

**Data frame is the most common data structure when manipulating ecological data**. A data set loaded from a spread sheet (we will address this later) will be automatically recognized as a data frame. Here is an example:

**Create a data frame**\
In the following example, variables `x` and `y` are organized into a single data frame `dat`. Variable are renamed when creating a data frame composed of `x` and `y`.

```{r}
# Create data frame
x <- c("Pristine", "Pristine", "Disturbed", "Disturbed", "Pristine") # Lake type
y <- c(1.2, 2.2, 10.9, 50.0, 3.0) # TSS: total suspended solids (mg/L)
dat <- data.frame(LakeType = x, TSS = y) # x is named as "LakeType" while y is named as "TSS"
dat
```

**Call column names**\
```{r}
colnames(dat) # call column names
```

**Access by columns**\
```{r}
dat$LakeType # access LakeType
dat$TSS # access TSS
```

You can access elements like a matrix as well:

```{r}

dat[,1] # access column #1
dat[1,] # access row #1
dat[c(2,4),] # access row #2 and 4

```

## Exercise

Download a <a href = "file/report01_temp.R" download>template</a> (R script file).

### Vector

a. Create three numeric vectors with length 3, 6 and 20, respectively. Each vector must be created using different functions in R.
b. Create three character vectors with length 3, 6 and 20, respectively. Each vector must be created using different functions in R.
c. Copy the following script to your R script and perform the following analysis:
  - Identify element IDs of `x` that are greater than `2.0`
  - Identify element values of `x` that are greater than `2.0`

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)

```


### Matrix

a. Create a numeric matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each column must contain identical elements.
b. Create a numeric matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each row must contain identical elements.
c. Create a character matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each column must contain identical elements.
d. Create a character matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each row must contain identical elements.
e. Copy the following script to your R script and perform the following analysis:
  - Identify element IDs of `x` that are greater than `2.0` (**specify row and column IDs**)
  - Identify element values of `x` that are greater than `2.0` and calculate the mean.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set.seed(1)
x <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

```



### Data Frame

a. Create a data frame of 3 variables with 10 elements (name variables as `x`, `y` and `z`. `x` must be `character` while `y` and `z` must be `numeric`.
b. Check the data structure (higher-level) of `x`, `y` and `z`
c. Copy the following script to your R script and perform the following analysis:
  - Calculate the means of `temperature` and `abundance` for states `VA` and `NC` separately - use `tapply()` function

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 3)
y <- rpois(100, lambda = 10)
z <- rep(c("VA", "NC"), 50)
dat <- data.frame(temperature = x, abundance = y, state = z)

```

# VISUALIZATION

---

## Overview

R has a number of functions that help visualize data.
`graphics` provides R functions for base graphics ([list of functions](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2)).
I will use `iris`, the built-in data set in R, to show how `graphics` functions work.

```{r}
iris
```

\
\

## `plot()`

When plotting data, what's you need is to specify the **formula**. For example, if you want to visualize the relationship between `x` and `y` (`y` on the vertical axis and `x` on the horizontal axis), the formula would be `y ~ x` (the left side of the formula will be on the vertical axis). In the `iris` data set, the following columns are available: `Sepal.Length` `Sepal.Width`  `Petal.Length` `Petal.Width`  `Species`. In the following example, the relationship between `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` is plotted:

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)

```

The argument `data =` tells the function the data set from which the variables (`Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`) are extracted. The above figure is the default setting, and you may customize it as necessary. Below is an example of how you may customize:

### Symbol
`pch` argument. Choose from `1` to `25` (google **r plot pch** for details)

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
     pch = 19)

```

### Symbol size
`cex` argument. `cex = 1` is the default value. `cex = 2` is as twice large as default value.

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
     pch = 19, cex = 2)

```

### Symbol color (border)
`col` argument (quote `"color name"` when specifying). Google **r color name** for color options.

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
     pch = 21, cex = 2, col = "gray")

```

### Symbol color (fill)
`bg` argument (quote `"color name"` when specifying). Available for a subset of symbol options (some symbols have pre-defined filled color).

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
     pch = 21, cex = 2, bg = "lightgray")

```

### Label
`ylab` or `xlab` arguments. Provide `"quoted text"`.

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
     pch = 21, cex = 2, bg = "lightgray",
     xlab = "Sepal width (cm)", ylab = "Sepal length (cm)")

```

### Axis
Delete axes with `axes = F` and re-draw with `box()` and `axis()` functions. 

```{r}

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
     pch = 21, cex = 2, bg = "lightgray",
     xlab = "Sepal width (cm)", ylab = "Sepal length (cm)",
     axes = F)
box(bty = "l") # L-shaped border lines
axis(1) # 1: draw x-axis
axis(2, las = 2) # 2: draw y-axis, las = 2: make axis lables horizontal

```

## `boxplot()`

`boxplot()` is used when the x-axis is factor-type data (by default, `plot()` will produce a boxplot when x-axis is a factor variable).
In the `iris` dataset, the column `Species` is a factor variable. Compare `Sepal.Length` among species using `boxplot()`.

```{r}

boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

```

You can customize as in `plot()`, but slighlty different.

### Box color
`col` argument.

```{r}

boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
        col = "lightgray")

```

### Border color
`border` argument.

```{r}

boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
        col = "lightgray", border = "grey48")

```


### Box width
`boxwex` argument.

```{r}

boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
        col = "lightgray", border = "grey48",
        boxwex = 0.4 )

```


### Axis
Delete axes with `axes = F` and re-draw with `box()` and `axis()` functions. 

```{r}

boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
        col = "lightgray", border = "grey48",
        boxwex = 0.4, ylab = "Sepal length (cm)",
        axes = F)
box(bty = "l")
axis(1, at = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("Setosa", "Versicolor", "Virginica") )
axis(2, las = 2)

```

## Exercise

Download a <a href="file/report02_temp.R" download>template</a> (R script file).

### `plot()` function

a. Plot the relationship between `Sepal.Width` and `Petal.Width`
b. Turn symbol color (border) into red.
c. Turn symbol color (fill) into red (set `pch = 21`).
d. Make symbol size larger.
e. Make L-shaped plot border (delete border lines on upper and right sides)

### `boxplot()` function

a. Plot the relationship between `Petal.Width` and `Species`.
b. Turn box color (border) into `blue`.
c. Make box width narrower.
