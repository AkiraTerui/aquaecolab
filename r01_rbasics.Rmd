# Getting Started

## Install R and R Studio

R and R Studio can be installed from the following websites:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (you can choose any CRAN mirror to download)
- [R Studio](https://rStudio.com/products/rStudio/download/)

While R is stand-alone software, I strongly recommend to use it with R Studio. R Studio has many functions that help your data analysis.


## Basic Setup

### Interface

![](image/R_image1.png)

R Studio interface. The left half of the screen is **“console”** where you put your script to execute calculation/data manipulation/analysis (ignore the tab “Terminal” at this point). The right bottom shows a folder in which you are working now – i.e., **“working folder or directory”**. R does not recognize any files outside of this folder, so be sure to pick the right directory when you work in R.

### Create Project
As you proceed, numerous materials will be produced, making it harder to put relevant things in one place. However, R Studio will help organize files by creating a project. To initiate the process of creating a project, **click the icon on the top bar or `File`**:

![](image/R_image2.png)

Select `New Directory`:

![](image/R_image3.png)

Select `New Project`:

![](image/R_image4.png)

A new window pops up and prompts you to name a directory and where to put the directory in your computer. Click `Browse` to select a location for the directory. I would create a folder for R projects (e.g., `RProject`) and put a project directory under this folder. Click **Create Project** once you decided directory name and location:

![](image/R_image5.png)

### Locate Yourself

Once you created a project, R Studio will take you to where the R project is located. Check the current directory using the following script:

```{r}
getwd()
```

If the path indicates where you are supposed to be, that's fine. However, when you next open R Studio, the initial location could be somewhere else. In that case, go to `File > Open Project` and open the `.Rproj` file that you just created. This will take you to the directory you are supposed to be.




## Object

Let’s play with R. Put the following script in your console.

```{r}
X <- c(10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2)
```

This script creates a vector of numbers composed of {10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2}. `X` is a ‘box’ where the vector information is stored, and ‘<-’ is the arrow that command R to store {10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2} in a box `X`. `X` is refered to as an **object**. Let’s see what’s in `X`:

```{r}
X
```

R has many functions that calculate the mean, median, etc. Let’s calculate a mean and median for `X`:

```{r}
mean(X)
median(X)
```

Also, you can pick an element(s) that you want. Numbers in brackets ‘[]’ specifies the numbered ID of each element. In the above example, element `X[3]` is `8.8`. You can extract this information with the following script:

```{r}
X[3]
```

You can also choose multiple elements simultaneously. For example, `3:5` specifies elements starting from 3 to 5 (colon creates a sequence of numbers):

```{r}
3:5
X[3:5]
```

If you want to pick elements that are not ordered sequentially, you can use `c()` to specify multiple elements:

```{r}
c(1,4)
X[c(1,4)]
```

## Arithmetic Operations

Addition

```{r}
1 + 1
121 + 123
```

Subtraction

```{r}
1 - 1 
121 - 123
```

Multiplication

```{r}
1 * 1
121 * 123
```

Division

```{r}
1 / 1
121 / 123
```

Power

```{r}
2^2
```

Square root

```{r}
sqrt(4)
4^(1/2)
```


## R Script & Console

In R Studio, we rarely write scripts directly in R console, where scripts are executed. This is because console does not save your scripts, so it is difficult to keep records of data manipulation and analysis. Instead, we write our scripts in ‘R script’, which lets you save and organize scripts in a separate window while enabling you to run scripts in R console quickly.

## Create R Script

To create ‘R script’, click an icon on the top bar and go to “R script” or “Ctrl + Shift + N”. Then, you will see a new window of R script in the left top:

![](image/R_image6.png)

![](image/R_image7.png)

## Run Scripts

You can run your script from the R script window. Write the following scripts:

```{r eval = F}
X <- c(10.1, 5.3, 8.8, 6.7, 8.2)
mean(X)
```

Writing these scripts in the R script window does not execute any calculation. To execute, select lines and `Ctrl + Enter`. Selected scripts will appear in the console and execute what you commanded:

![](image/R_image8.png)

![](image/R_image9.png)

Red ink tab indicates that your R script file is unsaved since your last edits.


## Compile a Report

R Studio has a function to compile a report from R scripts (see also [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) for details). Include the following script on the top of the R script file to put your information:

```{r eval = F}
#' ---
#' title: "Report"
#' author: Your Name
#' date: Jan 16, 2020
#' output: html_document
#' ---
```

Each argument determines the following:

- `title` title of your report
- `author` this appears below the title in the compiled report
- `date` date created
- `output` output format; use `html_document`

Click on the "compile" button on the top. This creates a report from your R script:

![](image/R_image10.png)

The R Studio will start compiling your report. Here is some rules when compiling a report.

- Your script will appear in a grey box. Put `#` if you want leave a comment on the script.
- Output from your script will appear in a white box with double sharps
- Text after `#'` will show up outside a grey box (text after `#` will be regarded as Header)

For example, the following script is compiled like this:

```{r eval = F}

#' ---
#' title: "Report"
#' author: Your Name
#' date: Jan 16, 2020
#' output: html_document
#' ---

#' # Header 1.1
#' ## Header 1.2
#' ### Header 1.3
#' This appears outside boxes

# inbox comment here
X <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
X

#' # Header 2.1
#' ## Header 2.2
#' ### Header 2.3
#' This text can be used to guide readers

# inbox comment here
Y <- 1:9
Y

```

## File Management

As you proceed, the number of files will increase. It is critical to learn basic rules of **how to locate and name your files in your computer**. Here are some recommendations:

- Put all the relevant files in a single folder.
  - R scripts and associated files should be saved in the project folder.
  - Create a new R project when working on different topics. Do not mix them up in a single folder.
- Avoid space and period when naming files. Instead, use underscore or hyphen.
  - Do: `script_week1.R` `script-week1.R`
  - Don't: `script week1.R`
- Use lowercases.
  - Do: `script_week1.R`
  - Don't: `Script_week1.R`
- Keep consistent.
  - For example, if your R script deals with figures, then name it `figure_XXX.R` (`XXX` identifies further details).
- Numbering will help keep your folder/directory organized.
  - `figure_temperature.R`, `figure_precipitation.R`...this will work, but the order of files may be confusing.
  - `figure_01_temperature.R`, `figure_02_precipitation.R`...this will organize files by group (`figure`) and numerically.

# Data Types and Structures

## Overview

R has 6 basic **data types**.

- character: `"aquatic"`, `"ecology"` (no order)
- factor: similar to character, but has *levels* (alphabetically ordered by default)
- numeric: `20.0` , `15.5`
- integer: `3`, `7`
- logical: `TRUE` , `FALSE`
- complex: `1+2i` (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)

These elements form one of the following **data structures**.  

- vector: a series of elements. ***A single data type is allowed in a single vector***
- matrix: elements organized into rows and columns. ***A single data type is allowed in a single matrix***
- data frame: looks similar to a matrix, but allows ***different data types in different columns***

## Vector
### Create Vector

Below are examples of atomic character vectors, numeric vectors, integer vectors, etc. There are many ways to create vector data. The following examples use `c()`, `:`, `seq()`, `rep()`:

```{r}

#ex.1a manually create a vector using c()
X <- c(1,3,4,8)
X

#ex.1b character
X <- c("a", "b", "c")
X

#ex.1c logical
X <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
X

#ex.2 sequence of numbers
X <- 1:5
X

#ex.3a replicate same numbers or characters
X <- rep(2, 5) # replicate 2 five times
X

#ex.3b replicate same numbers or characters
X <- rep("a", 5) # replicate "a" five times
X

#ex.4a use seq() function
X <- seq(1, 5, by = 1)
X

#ex.4b use seq() function
X <- seq(1, 5, by = 0.1)
X

```

### Check Features

R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example:

- `class()` - what kind of object (data structure) is it (high-level)?
- `typeof()` - what is the object’s data type (low-level)?
- `attributes()` - does it have any metadata?
- `length()` - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
- `sum()` - what is the summed number of the data?
- `mean()` - what is the average number of the data?

#### Numeric Vector

```{r}

X <- c(1.2, 3.1, 4.0, 8.2)
X
class(X)
typeof(X)
length(X)
sum(X)
mean(X)

```

#### Character Vector

```{r}

Y <- c("a", "b", "c")
class(Y)
length(Y)

```
  
### Access
#### Element ID

Use brackets `[]` when accessing specific elements in an object.
For example, if you want to access element #2 in the vector `X`, you may specify as `X[2]`:

```{r}

X <- c(2,2,3,2,5)
X[2] # access element #2
X[c(2,4)] # access elements #2 and 4
X[2:4] # access elements #2-4

```

#### Equation

R provides many ways to access elements that suffice specific conditions. You can use mathematical symbols to specify what you need, for example:

- `==` equal
- `>` larger than
- `>=` equal & larger than
- `<` smaller than
- `<=` equal & smaller than
- `which()` a function that returns element # that suffices the specified condition

The following examples return a logical vector indicating whether each element in X suffices the specified condition:

```{r}

# creating a vector
X <- c(2,2,3,2,5)

# ex.1a equal
X == 2

# ex.1b larger than
X > 2 

```

You can access elements that suffice the specified condition using brackets, for example:

```{r}

# ex.2a equal
X[X == 2]
# ex.2b larger than
X[X > 2]

```

Using `which()`, you can see which elements (i.e., #) matches what you need:

```{r}

# ex.3a equal
which(X == 2) # returns which elements are equal to 2
# ex.3b larger than
which(X > 2)

```

## Matrix
### Create Matrix

Matrix is a set of elements (*single data type*) that are organized into rows and columns:

```{r}

#ex.1 cbind: combine objects by column
X <- cbind(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))
X

#ex.2 rbind: combine objects by row
X <- rbind(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))
X

#ex.3 matrix: specify elements and the number of rows (nrow) and columns (ncol)
X <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
X

```

### Check Features

R provides many functions to examine features of matrix data, for example:

- `class()` what kind of object (data structure) is it (high-level)?
- `typeof()` what is the object’s data type (low-level)?
- `attributes()` does it have any metadata?
- `dim()` how long are rows and columns?
- `rowSums()` what is the summed number of the data for each row?
- `colSums()` what is the summed number of the data for each column?

#### Integer Matrix

```{r}

X <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
X
class(X)
typeof(X)
dim(X)

```

#### Character Matrix

```{r}

Y <- matrix(c("a","b", "c", "d", "e", "f"), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
Y
class(Y)
typeof(Y)
dim(Y)

```

### Access

When accessing matrix elements, you need to pick row(s) and/or column(s), for example:

```{r}

X <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
X
X[2,3] # access an element in row #2 and colum #3
X[2,] # access elements in row #2
X[c(2,3),] # access elements in rows #2 and 3
X[,c(2,3)] # access elements in columns #2 and 3

```

You can assess each element with mathematical expressions just like vectors:

```{r}

X == 2 # equal
X > 2 # larger than

```

However, care must be taken when accessing elements, as it will be automatically converted to vector data:

```{r}

X[X == 2] # equal
X[X > 2] # larger than

```

`which()` needs an additional argument to return both row and column #:

```{r}

which(X == 2, arr.ind = TRUE)
which(X > 2, arr.ind = TRUE)

```

## Data Frame

Data frame is a set of elements that are organized into rows and columns, but differ in several ways.

- it allows *multiple data types* in different columns
- each column has its *name*
- access columns by name (using `$`)

***Data frame is the most common data structure when manipulating ecological data***. A data set loaded from a spread sheet (we will address this later) will be automatically recognized as a data frame. Here is an example:

```{r}

# Create data frame
X <- c("Pristine", "Pristine", "Disturbed", "Disturbed", "Pristine") # Lake type
Y <- c(1.2, 2.2, 10.9, 50.0, 3.0) # TSS: total suspended solids (mg/L)
dat <- data.frame(LakeType = X, TSS = Y) # X is named as "LakeType" while Y is named as "TSS"
dat
colnames(dat) # call column names
dat$LakeType # access LakeType
dat$TSS # access TSS
class(dat) # check feature
class(dat$LakeType) # check feature of LakeType
class(dat$TSS) # check feature of TSS

```

You can access elements like a matrix as well:

```{r}

dat[,1] # access column #1
dat[1,] # access row #1
dat[c(2,4),] # access row #2 and 4

```

## Exercise
### Basics
#### Vector

- Create three numeric vectors with length 3, 6 and 20, respectively. Each vector must be created using different functions in R.
- Create three character vectors with length 3, 6 and 20, respectively. Each vector must be created using different functions in R.

#### Matrix
- Create a numeric matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each column must contain identical elements.
- Create a numeric matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each row must contain identical elements.
- Create a character matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each column must contain identical elements.
- Create a character matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each row must contain identical elements.
- Check the data structure (high-level) of each matrix.

#### Dataframe
- Create a dataframe with 3 variables (name variables as `X`, `Y` and `Z`. `X` must be `character` while `Y` and `Z` must be `numeric`.
- Check the data structure (higher-level) of `X`, `Y` and `Z`

### Advanced
#### Vector

Copy the following script to your R script:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)

```

- Identify element IDs of `x` that are greater than `2.0`
- Identify element values of `x` that are greater than `2.0`

#### Matrix

Copy the following script to your R script:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set.seed(1)
X <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

```

- Identify element IDs of `X` that are greater than `2.0` (**specify row and column IDs**)
- Identify element values of `X` that are greater than `2.0` and caluculate the mean.

#### Data Frame

Copy the following script to your R script:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 3)
y <- rpois(100, lambda = 10)
z <- rep(c("VA", "NC"), 50)
dat <- data.frame(temperature = x, abundance = y, state = z)

```

- Calculate means of `temperature` and `abundance` for states `VA` and `NC` separately
