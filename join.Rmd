### We're hiring!!

The Department of Biology is currently seeking a highly motivated Post-Doctoral Fellow to work in the Aquatic Ecology Laboratory of Dr. Akira Terui (https://aterui.github.io/aquaecolab/). The Post-Doctoral Fellow will work on an NSF-funded project which aims to understand the divers of food chain length in rivers. The project employs mathematical / statistical methods and meta-analysis approaches to advance the conceptual understanding of how food chain length is determined in natural systems. Therefore, the postdoc should be proficient in programming, preferably in R or other relevant languages. The postdoc is expected to communicate his/her results through publications in scientific journals, presentations at professional meetings, and/or outreach events.

If interested, send me an email with a research statement and your CV. The position is open until filled.


### Undergraduate students

Students who are interested in freshwater ecology/spatial ecology/quantitative ecology are encouraged to contact me (a_terui at uncg.edu). Opportunities exist to learn field research skills and statistical modeling with R.
