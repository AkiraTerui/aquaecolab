### We're hiring!!

The Department of Biology is currently seeking a highly motivated Post-Doctoral Fellow to work in the Aquatic Ecology Laboratory of Dr. Akira Terui (https://aterui.github.io/aquaecolab/). The Post-Doctoral Fellow will work on a project that uses spatial ecological theories to inform spatial prioritization of conservation efforts in threatened freshwater ecosystems (e.g., oxbow lakes). The project employs advanced simulation and statistical methods to identify key habitats for focal aquatic species and to inform conservation actions. Therefore, the postdoc should be proficient in programming, preferably in R and/or C++. The postdoc is expected to communicate his/her results through publications in scientific journals and presentations at professional meetings. Also, the postdoc is expected to organize workshops and outreach events to disseminate his/her results to the public. The preferred start date is July 1 2021 but negotiable.

To find details on application requirements and to apply, visit https://spartantalent.uncg.edu/ and click on “Research – Post-Doc” scroll to “Post-Doctoral Fellow – Terui” (Position #998437). A CV, Research Statement, and list of three references is required. Review will start on May 31 2021 but the position is open until filled.
