## Data transformation

Data transformation is a critical component of data analysis. You can use spreadsheets or similar to manage your data. However, this form of data manipulation/transformation should be limited to the process of creating the primary dataset. There are several reasons for this. **First and foremost, a spreadsheet does NOT keep records of your edits.** If you make any mistake during the process of data transformation, those will be unnoticed. **Second, a spreadsheet is not well suited to data transformation.** You may need to iterate the same transformation multiple times, and you will make an error sooner or later.
